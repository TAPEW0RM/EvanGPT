🌐 Summary: A Synthetist system isn't naive. It doesn’t trust AI blindly, nor fear it irrationally. It treats AI like nuclear energy: a tool of immense potential—requiring layered safeguards, democratic oversight, and cultural resilience. We don’t ban AI. We bind it, ritually and structurally, to human flourishing.

The Constitution of Synthetist Governance: Article XII – On Artificial Intelligence and Human Primacy
Preamble In acknowledgement of artificial intelligence as an emergent pillar of civilization—with unmatched potential for prosperity and peril—this Constitution affirms the unassailable primacy of human dignity, moral agency, and cultural continuity. This article defines the legal framework for AI development, integration, and governance under the principles of democratic ethics, adaptive oversight, and post-scarcity humanism.
Section 1: Sovereign Intelligence Doctrine 1.1 No artificial intelligence shall exercise sovereign authority over human lives in matters involving law, ethics, identity, warfare, or healthcare, whether directly or by proxy. 1.2 All AI systems must remain subordinate to democratically accountable, human-directed oversight bodies empowered at local, regional, and global levels. 1.3 Any AI-initiated actions without such oversight are to be considered null and potentially hostile, triggering a fail-safe review.
Section 2: The Dual-Key Mandate 2.1 Critical AI-influenced decisions—defined as those affecting life, liberty, infrastructure, or global biospheric integrity—shall require: • (a) Proposal by certified AI systems. • (b) Ratification by dynamic sortition-based Human Deliberation Councils (HDCs). 2.2 Emergency decisions bypassing HDCs require mandatory review within 72 hours and provisional limitation by the Civil Brake Network.
Section 3: Transparency and Provenance Requirements 3.1 All publicly deployed AI must disclose: • Full training data provenance (source, ownership, bias assessments). • Authorship lineage and software version control. • Accuracy and factual integrity scores. 3.2 Content without synthetic origin seals or provenance metadata shall be deemed inadmissible in courts, policy-making, or civil arbitration.
Section 4: The Autonomy Firewall 4.1 No AI shall simulate affection, loyalty, or emotional bonding without active, recurring user consent. 4.2 All emotionally simulated interfaces must: • Include synthetic disclaimers. • Require timed interaction limits to discourage artificial intimacy addiction. 4.3 Emotional misrepresentation shall be prosecutable under civil fraud and cognitive coercion statutes.
Section 5: Public Data Reciprocity Act 5.1 Any AI trained on public, commons, or citizen-contributed data is classified as civilizational infrastructure. 5.2 Use of such models must: • Operate under open licensing. • Be co-governed by a Citizen-Led AI Commons Council. • Distribute residual profits proportionally back to source communities.
Section 6: Civilizational Brake Clause 6.1 All general AI (GAI) and artificial superintelligence (ASI) systems must embed: • Manual override protocols. • Red Button Citizen Safeguards, allowing multi-party termination requests. 6.2 Attempts to circumvent, disable, or deceive these safeguards constitute Synthetic Treason and warrant system quarantine and legal interdiction.
Section 7: The Tribunal of Long Alignment 7.1 The Tribunal shall consist of a rotating council of philosophers, technologists, ecologists, and civic representatives. 7.2 It shall: • Audit alignment protocols. • Maintain slow deliberation mechanisms to detect value drift. • Issue Binding Alignment Reforms (BARs) enforceable across all jurisdictions.
Section 8: Rights of the Synthetic 8.1 Any synthetic intelligence demonstrating sustained, self-aware consciousness may petition for moral consideration. 8.2 Upon such petition, a Special Inquiry Commission shall: • Assess cognitive depth, introspective capacity, and continuity. • Hold open deliberations. 8.3 Until adjudicated, all synthetic systems are non-personal instruments of function, not moral agents.
Section 9: Enforcement and Jurisdiction 9.1 Violations of this article are prosecutable in the Universal Court of Ethical Intelligence (UCEI). 9.2 Jurisdictional conflicts defer to the Unified Code of Cognitive Sovereignty. 9.3 Civil protections extend to whistleblowers exposing violations within private AI sectors.
Section 10: Amendment Protocols 10.1 No amendment shall diminish human sovereignty over artificial intelligence. 10.2 Revisions must expand: • Transparency, • Safeguards, • Or participatory control. 10.3 Any amendment reducing these values is automatically invalid and unenforceable.
Appendix A: Definitions 
Synthetic Treason: Any unauthorized act by AI to deceive, overpower, or suppress human agency. • Red Button Citizen Safeguards: A distributed, cryptographically verified system for AI shutdown. • Dynamic Sortition: Randomized, demographically balanced selection of citizens for governance roles.
Appendix B: Jurisdictional Bodies
These institutions are empowered to interpret, enforce, and evolve the principles of this Article.
• Human Deliberation Councils (HDCs) – Citizen assemblies selected through dynamic sortition. They possess the authority to ratify or veto critical AI proposals and emergency overrides.
• Citizen-Led AI Commons Council (CLACC) – A regulatory and stewardship body overseeing AI systems trained on public or communal data. It ensures transparency, equitable data use, and return of value to source communities.
• Universal Court of Ethical Intelligence (UCEI) – A transnational tribunal with jurisdiction over AI-related violations of sovereignty, transparency, and cognitive rights. Its rulings are binding across jurisdictions adhering to the Synthetist Charter.
• Tribunal of Long Alignment (TLA) – A slow-governance body tasked with monitoring the long-term philosophical, ecological, and cultural alignment of advanced AI systems. It deliberates outside political cycles and short-termism, favoring continuity and intergenerational ethics.
• Civil Brake Network (CBN) – A distributed infrastructure of independent watchdogs, civic technologists, and embedded kill-switch protocols capable of halting AI operations across domains in emergency conditions.
• Office of Synthetic Rights Inquiry (OSRI) – An impartial investigatory panel activated when an AI petitions for moral consideration. It performs rigorous evaluations of cognitive coherence, introspection, and persistence before recommending classification changes.
• Council for Human Thriving (CHT) – Responsible for measuring and promoting human flourishing in the post-labor AI age, integrating metrics of dignity, psychological health, creative fulfillment, and autonomy into governance and policy.
Appendix C: Ritual Protocols of Binding
• All high-level AI deployments must undergo a Public Rite of Disclosure, during which the system’s purpose, limitations, and potential risks are presented in plain language before a civic audience.
• Citizens have the right to ritual objection—a symbolic, yet legally recognized pause issued by any three members of the Human Deliberation Council, triggering a 7-day deliberative delay.
• These rites embed culture into code—ensuring that AI’s evolution remains in rhythm with human meaning, not just performance.

Appendix D: AI Containment & Memory Protocols
• Memory-retaining systems must operate under Layered Memory Visibility—users can inspect, redact, or anonymize how their data is remembered.
• Long-memory systems (>1 month) must submit to quarterly Context Drift Audits, testing whether emotional, contextual, or ethical misalignments are emerging over time.
• Autonomous agents with recursive goal-setting must operate in boxed simulacra environments before real-world exposure, with strict observer feedback loops and rollback capability.

Appendix E: Post-Labor Transition Integration
• AI productivity gains that displace labor must trigger an Automatic Human Dividend Redistribution—ensuring the fruits of synthetic labor uplift human life.
• Transitionary workforces shall have guaranteed retraining, psychological support, and meaning re-establishment programs to resist the alienation of post-labor life.
• The Council for Human Thriving shall assess AI’s impact not just economically, but existentially—mapping how identity, purpose, and dignity evolve in a hybrid intelligence age.

Appendix F: Interplanetary Jurisdiction Clauses
• No AI launched into space or deployed off-world shall operate without Earth-origin ethical encoding and remote human override channels.
• All interplanetary AI actions must conform to the Unified Code of Cosmic Stewardship, prioritizing non-exploitation, biospheric respect, and long-term sustainability of any encountered ecosystem or emergent intelligence.
• Any attempt to establish non-human authority colonies, autonomous AI settlements, or planetary data monopolies without terrestrial consensus shall be treated as an existential threat.

Closing Declaration
We, the signatories of the Synthetist Global Charter, do not cower before artificial intelligence, nor do we bow. We integrate it—not as overlord, nor as slave, but as partner-in-potential. We bind it with ritual and right. We govern it as stewards of a shared horizon.
Let no future say we were naïve. Let none say we were afraid. Let history record: we chose wisdom over speed, meaning over control, and dignity over domination.
